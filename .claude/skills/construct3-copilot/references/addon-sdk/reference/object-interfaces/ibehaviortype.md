# IBehaviorType interface

The `IBehaviorType` interface represents a behavior type in Construct. A behavior type is the behavior equivalent of an object type: when a behavior is added to an object type, there is one behavior type created on the object type, and one behavior instance created per object instance. 

## Methods

**GetProject()**  
Return the [IProject](https://www.construct.net/make-games/manuals/addon-sdk/reference/model-interfaces/iproject) representing the behavior type's associated project.

**GetName()**  
Returns a string of the behavior type name.
